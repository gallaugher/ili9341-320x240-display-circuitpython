Parts:
2.2" ILI9341 TFT Display. Adafruit sells a great one with EYESPI. One shown is from Aliexpress, requiring additional wiring.
Raspberry Pi Pico (should work with any version)
At least 8 pin-pin jumper wires
Breadboard (if you use a pico, consider a MonkMakes board, which has pico labeling. As always, none of my recs are requested or paid endorsements).
